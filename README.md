# Linguistics AI Projects  
A portfolio of linguistics projects simulating real-world federal and AI-focused use cases, including coded language decoding, wiretap transcription, and GUI-based tools using Python.

## 🕵️ Mock Wiretap Analysis – Caribbean Dialect

**Project Description:**  
This mock wiretap simulates a jailhouse call intercepted between two individuals coordinating a time-sensitive exchange. The dialogue includes regional slang (“el ticket,” “verdes,” “el taller”) and hidden meanings often used to obscure criminal activity.

**Deliverables:**  
- Spanish-language transcript with English translation  
- Intelligence-style final report summarizing key players, objectives, and contextual dialect analysis  
- Applied Python scripting to flag suspicious terms and slang variants  
- GUI tool for phrase input and red flag detection

## 🇲🇽 Mock Wiretap Analysis – Mexican Dialect

**Project Description:**  
This simulated jail call focuses on Mexican-coded language, analyzing phrases like “el ticket,” “los verdes,” and “el taller” within a short but loaded exchange. The goal is to decode implied criminal logistics using cultural context.

**Deliverables:**  
- Original transcript in Spanish and English translation  
- Final summary report with role analysis and coded language interpretation  
- Python slang decoder script that flags predefined key terms  
- CLI tool to test slang phrases and detect high-risk expressions

**Files:**  
- [`slang_decoder.py`](slang_decoder.py)  
- [`example_transcript.txt`](example_transcript.txt)

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repo or download individual scripts  
2. Run `.py` files in a Python environment (VS Code or Terminal recommended)  
3. For GUI versions, just run the script and input a phrase for live decoding
